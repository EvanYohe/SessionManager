# Citations List
Any time I watched a Youtube video, checked a Stackoverflow page, or looked up any type of resource, the first thing I did before analyzing any of the content on the page was to cite it just in case. Due to this process and the large number of citations, some resources may be listed but unsused, however any resource used should be listed.

I did **not** cite any sources from the Java documentation however it was used ***extensively.*** If you want to see a list of all the pages in the Java documentation that I visited, that can be provided.
