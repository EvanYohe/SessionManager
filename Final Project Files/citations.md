# Citations List
The scope of this project is fairly advanced for the class level. Because the nature of my final project involved the entire android development ecosystem, a large number of citations is expected and needed. 
Any time I watched a youtube video, checked a stackoverflow page, or looked up any type of digital resource, the first thing I did before analyzing any of the content on the page was to cite it just in case.
Due to this process and the large number of citations, some resources may be listed but unsused, however any resource used should be listed.
