# README
This is the readme page for the final project of CS& 141. I chose to create a program to track musical practice sessions, in addition to analyzing efficiency and efficacy of the practice sessions. The contents of this README is as follows

- [Notes](##-Notes) These are miscellaneous notes about the project that might offer insight about why I made the decisions that I made.
- [Scope](##-Scope) This is the scope of the project. There will be two scopes listed here; a scope of the project as a whole, and a scope of the project as it relates to the final assignment
- [Goals](##-Goals) These are the goals of the project. The goals listed here may extend beyond the scope of the final project, however I do plan on continuing to develop this app after the assignment is submitted.
- [TODO](##-TODO) This is the TODO list for the project. I use this TODO list in tandem with the flowchart I created to organize the development process into manageable chunks.
- [File List](##-File-List) A file tree of the project. I will omit unnecessary files, such as project manager files, IDE files, build files, etc...

## Notes
- I chose to use a project manager (Maven) to organize the project. As I was creating the project outline, I realized that it would be best to split the code into different modules that each have a specific task. Once I started to organize the modules, building and compiling the project became more and more difficult and a manager significantly simplified the process.

## Scope
This is the actual scope of the project, given the timeframe assigned. I fully expect some topics listed in the Goals section of this readme to not be implemented when the assignment is turned in at the end of the quarter. My scope for the assignment itself will be listed below, while the scope of the project itself is listed in the Goals section of the readme.

## Goals
My goal for this project is to have a fully functioning practice tracking application I can personally use on a daily basis. I hope that the project will be feature rich by the time I submit the assignment, however I am intentionally planning the scope of the project to be larger than the scope of the assignment itself.

- Create, edit, and delete Practice Sessions
- Create and delete keywords
- Calculate and display statistic for a single sessions
- Calculate and display statistics for a range of sessions
- Calculate and display statistics for the global range of sessions (all)
- Save and retrieve session data to a JSON file
- Search for session(s) by keyword
- Print formatted information to the terminal

## File List
There are some files in the repository that are not important for the grading process. Things like project manager files, build files, config files, etc... will be omitted from the file list so you can easily see where the actual written code is.
